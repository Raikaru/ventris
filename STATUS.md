# STATUS

## Current phase/generation
Stage 2-3: worker protocol + differential test landed; store ownership next.

## Completed and verified
- Scrap of the old partial-decompiler-port architecture; pinned Ghidra
  12.1.3 reference tree kept and hash-manifested (commit 993605f, 8cf03d3).
- Java bridge (`service/`): JSON-RPC over stdio; methods import/open/close/
  functions/function/symbols/read_memory/xrefs_to/xrefs_from/
  function_xrefs_from/export_facts/rename/decompile/disassemble/ping/
  dump_specs. Written against verified Ghidra sources only.
- Rust workspace: lre-model, lre-db (SQLite WAL+FK, schema_version=1,
  revision-stamped mutations), lre-core (CoreService facade),
  lre-cli, lre-worker. 14/14 unit tests pass.
- E2E proven on x86-64 ELF fixture (gcc -O0, 12.6 KB):
  - import: 15 functions, 34 xrefs, 93 symbols persisted with
    provenance `ghidra-bridge / 12.1.3`
  - store-only `open` (no JVM launched): works
  - rename persists in store, revision bump verified in unit tests
  - decompile + disasm through bridge against saved program
- Native worker protocol (lre-worker) fixed to the pinned C++ exactly:
  - registerProgram (queries answered from store/binary),
  - arch-id frame for decompileAt/setAction (ghidra_process.cc:82-97),
  - packed `<addr>` element + attribute ids from the marshal tables,
  - response tail (result stream, warnings frame 0x10..0x11, 0x07),
  - interleaved queries inside the result stream (Java readResponse model),
  - callbacks: getBytes, getMappedSymbols (doc/mapsym/function),
    getRegister, getRegisterName, getCodeLabel, getUserOpName,
    isNameUsed (bool), tracked-register pointset, plus safe empties.
  - deferred cleanly: stdin close before wait (Drop no longer deadlocks).
- Differential test (tests/differential.sh): x86-64 ELF, native (pinned
  console decompiler, no JVM) vs bridge oracle:
  - add: both decompile to "return A + B" (oracle params vs native
    unaff registers normalized),
  - main: both call add (0x400466) and printf (0x400370), return 0.
  - PASS: native matches the oracle modulo naming.

## Measured (benchmarks/reports/)
- Stock Ghidra (analyzeHeadless, tiny ELF fixture, 3 runs): median wall
  10.83 s, median peak process-tree RSS 375 MiB.
- Native spike: pinned C++ decompiler + sleigh_opt compiled x86-64.sla;
  `add` and `main` decompiled with zero JVM in the process tree
  (benchmarks/reports/native-spike.md).
- Stage-1 CLI import (bridge): ~5-10 s Ghidra work + ~7 s JVM startup.

## Known gaps / risks
- Protocol worker (lre-worker) decompileAt succeeds through
  mappedsymbols/register/tracked callbacks but the decompiler's
  per-instruction pcode comes from the CLIENT (GhidraTranslate::
  oneInstruction -> getPcode query, ghidra_translate.cc:127). Answering
  getPcode needs a native SLEIGH pcode generator; today the differential
  covers the no-JVM path via the console (raw architecture) instead.
- Bridge project lock is single-writer: concurrent CLI invocations fail
  with "Unable to lock project" (Ghidra project lock); stale locks need
  manual removal after an aborted JVM.
- Decompilation latency bounded by JVM startup for one-shot CLI use; a
  persistent service session amortizes it.
- `Loaded.save`+`ProgramLoader` path persists correctly, but re-import of
  the same binary name creates `.1` duplicates (Ghidra duplicate naming).
- The CLI's `xrefs --from <entry>` is address-addressed.

## Next bounded task
Stage 2-3 remainder: native getPcode server (SLEIGH pcode generation for
GhidraTranslate::oneInstruction) and store ownership depth (comments,
types, PE import into project.sqlite).
