# Changelog

All notable Ventris changes are documented here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Bounded binary inspection and address resolution for ELF, PE, COFF,
  Mach-O, Intel HEX, Motorola S-record, and supported console containers.
- Native lifting and checked-in p-code/decompiler corpus coverage across the
  documented architecture paths.
- Console target profiles and evidence-backed ABI/type recovery through the
  CLI, Python API, HTTP server, and VS Code integration.
- Persistent bounded native-analysis memoization with fail-closed snapshots.
- Source-backed corpus metadata and opt-in hash-verified real-image smoke tests.
- Release packaging now emits and verifies native archives, VSIX payloads, and
  Python wheel/source artifacts with policy and provenance files.
- Release smoke gates exercise the optimized release-profile executable before
  archive packaging.
- Cross-platform native release smoke checks, strict archive verification, and
  GPUI persisted-project acceptance coverage.

### Known limitations

- Native semantic parity is proven for the checked-in corpus, not for every
  instruction or every compiler idiom on every supported processor.
- Game recovery is an initial vertical slice. Engine/runtime pattern models and
  matching-C emission are not complete.
- The Python package forwards to an externally installed Ventris executable; it
  does not bundle a platform-specific Rust binary.
- The HTTP server has no authentication or TLS and is intended for loopback
  use only.
- Manual visual VS Code acceptance remains a release check; the GPUI desktop
  workspace has a recorded populated-project smoke.
